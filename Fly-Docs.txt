V1
We have created a scene for the game and found a spaceship to use as one of the 
players. We found other ships that we may be able to use for choices for the player that
could have different stats on movement speed and health, implementing more ships would
be an extra piece we would only add if we had enough time.
 
V2
The can now be controlled by the arrow keys and can be move on the x and y axes.
Note that this is a 2D game. We were also able to make the background scene scroll by 
from the top down.

V3
Added a basic prototype start screen 


In the future we are first going to focus on the enemies, implementing a basic AI 
system and a looting system, enemies that are destroyed will drop pickups that will
upgrade the players guns, armour, and shield.

After that we need to implement the shooting for both the enemies and the player and the
shield for the player.

We would like to implement obstacles that must be avoided or destroyed with pickups 
released if destroyed.
